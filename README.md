## 💡 ABOUT THE PROJECT

The AI-Based Language Translator facilitates the translation of multilingual text, speech, images (via OCR), audio, and files within a unified platform. It provides functionalities such as grammar correction, pronunciation assistance, speech input and output capabilities, as well as multi-language batch translation, thereby enhancing accessibility for a wider audience. Additionally, the system incorporates a translation history feature, which allows users to effectively monitor and reutilize previous translations.

## ✨ OBJECTIVES

- The main objective of this project to develop an AI-powered language translation system that can translate text, speech, image (OCR), audio  and file translation in multiple languages.
 
 - To help users correct grammar and spelling mistakes in their input and enable multi-language batch for translating input text into several languages simultaneously.

- To show pronunciation guides for better understanding of English words.
 
- To provide speech to text and translated text to speech audio features.  


## ⚙️🕰️ EXISTING SYSTEM 📝🔹

- Most platforms focus on single-functionality (e.g., only text translation or speech translation), without integrating multiple features into one unified system.

- Common systems lack grammar correction or spelling improvement before translating the input, leading to inaccurate translations.

- They do not support image translation with OCR, text file translation with correction, or multi-language batch translation from a single input.

- Existing systems do not provide phonetic transcription or speech pronunciation guidance for learners.


## 🚀🤖 PROPOSED SYSTEM 🌟🗣️

💬 It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning libraries like googletrans, gTTS, SpeechRecognition, and Tesseract OCR to detect, translate, and pronounce content in multiple languages.

✅ The system provides grammar and spelling correction using a combination of pyspellchecker, TextBlob python libraries.

🔊 Speech & Pronunciation Guide.

📸 Image OCR Translation.

📂 It allows users to translate one text into many languages at the same time with multi-language batch translation.

🌈 Student-Friendly & Colorful UI.
